  Test Configuration: NuGet Package Sources

  This file exists at the repository root to support automated testing of the
  dotnet-package action. During tests, a local NuGet server runs at localhost:5001
  to verify package publishing functionality.

  Why this file is needed:
  - The dotnet-package action performs a git checkout without skipCheckout=false
  - This checkout resets the workspace wiping out test files we try to copy in place first
  - The tests need a NuGet.Config which sets allowInsecureConnections=true for the local test source
